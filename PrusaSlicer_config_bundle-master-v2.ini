filament_notes = ";Step 1. you will need your (ESTEPS) to be calibrated documentation on how to do this can be found here (the same applies to all creality products and most extruders if not all ) https://youtu.be/r8fw7QJVNHY\nOR\nhttps://teachingtechyt.github.io/calibration.html#esteps\n\n;Step 2. Using (METAL) accurate calipers ( Accuracy of approx + or - 0.02mm or lower ) you will be measuring the filament diameter from the extruder to the spool ( This is because not all spools are TRUE 1.75mm due to how filament extruders work using a screw based extruder ) you will be taking 8 measurements along the filament and writing them down in a calculator and get the average diameter\n (EXAMPLE: 1.73+1.72+1.73+1.73+1.71 + 1.72 + 1.73 + 1.72 =  13.79 then ÷ by 8 which = 1.72375 but we will only be using the first 3 values so my average diameter is 1.72 ) COPY THE STANDARD PROFILE AND MARK THE VALUE YOU GET INTO THE STANDARD PROFILE FOR USE ON YOUR PRINTER ( under filament settings > Filament > Diameter )\n\n;Step 3. (FLOW CALIBRATION) You will be printing out a cube (LINK BELOW) using the (CALIBRATION Nozzle) adjustment it has already been set to 1.0 extrusion multiplier as a (START POINT) The line widths are changed so you can get a accurate baseline of (EXAMPLE: 0.4mm and not 0.45 like the standard profiles) USE THIS TO TEST FLOW  (some flow results may be off and is best to use your eyes a good baseline  is that your walls wont join up or semi start then stop and make weird results seemingly unjoined this tends to be a cause of (UNDEREXTRUSION) or if you start to notice your walls getting truly puffy but notice your lines sometimes go off every now and then this is OVEREXTRUSION seemingly the excess flow escapes the nozzle at points due to an over excess amount of pressure built up then expelled (FLOW CAN BE CALCULATED BETTER OVER UNDER EXTRUSION BUT EYES TELL THE KEY: PLEASE READ UNDER THE CALCULATOR FOR AN EXAMPLE OF UNDEREXTRUSION WITH A CALIBRATION CUBE) in cases where you have a off flow result you may let the flow stabilize back over a print or 2 of the calibration cube and then once the results seem consistant you can modify the values of EXTRUSION MULTIPLIER up or down as you SEE with your eyes \n\nhttps://teachingtechyt.github.io/calibration.html#flow\nARTICLE: https://3dprintbeginner.com/flow-rate-calibration/\n\n\n;Step 4. if your results are not good or you have odd results when you look close at the layers of the cube or any of these tests you may check if your machine is built correctly,making sure v slot wheels are not warped,making sure your z leadscrew is well oiled, making sure to get your eccentric nuts properly adjusted, all your axis bars are aligned and straight, make sure you dont have a cracked extruder arm, a common issue is that the z motor may need a shim, make sure your hotend is seated correctly, (if bl touch or cr touch : making sure this is atleast pretty aligned and square)\n\n;Step 5. your first layer is VERY important since everything stands on that one single layer put on your printers bed i suggest using the provided link and model to accurately test your offset (as you go from higher above the build plate to lower this can begin backing up your nozzle so the best thing you can do is to RE-RUN the test a few times just to get a accurate baseline going where the materials lines get squished enough to say you closed the gap (may be a minor small gap) photos tend to have a hard time showing that the layers dont actually go 100% smooth and you will have minor diviations based off of it but you should be able to just feel the layers with your nails as minor bumps in the plastic THIS IS NORMAL \n\nhttps://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/tool/long-first-layer-cube\n\n\n;Step 6. if you have went over the printer and all seems built correctly you should be able to move onto the next steps (found in NOTES under PRINT SETTINGS:STANDARD NOZZLES)"
